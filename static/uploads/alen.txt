Emus are found in Australia. They are unusual birds.
They don't use twitter. According to some fools, these
birds make tick-toks, and have started a new trend
called 'Emu Memu', Scientists are still discovering about
this new trend. These birds can't fly: they walk and run.
as fas as 50 kmph (IDK if thats true), with a 3m running
stride! They belong to a group of flightless birds called
Ratties.
